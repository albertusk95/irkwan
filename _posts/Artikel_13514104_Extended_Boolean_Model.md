<h2>Chapter 1, An Introduction to Information Retrieval</h2>
<p>Starting from the basic; Information Retrieval is a broad term that can be summarized as &quot;taking  thing(s) that fullfill criteria(s) from collection&quot;. Even deciding which cereal box your little cousin Billy will like most for his 6th birthday party can be considered as a form of IR; however as an actual academic field of study its more formal definition is:</p>
<p>&quot;The act of finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers)&quot;</p>
<p>The most visible aplication for this field can be seen at Web Search Engine such as Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, AOL, Ask,  and of course.. Lycos. The way this sites work is fairly simple to understand yet hard to implements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sites ask for &quot;the criteria(s)&quot; of the webpage we want in form of a Query.</li>
<li>It then proceeds to traverse &quot;the collection&quot; of webpages, and give each one &quot;relevance point&quot; on how well this webpage fullfill the Query</li>
<li>Finally, the sites display the result in form of a list of page with the most relevant page on top, descending according to relevance point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the unstructured nature of a webpage, it would be very difficult to process a user query on its raw form. That is why IR usually pre-process each website into a suitable model; think of it as the website cover, it gives the system a sense of what the sites contain without needing to read the whole thing. There are all sort of model already developed for IR system, each whith its own query format, advantages, and disadvantages. One of such model is The Extended Boolean Model.</p>
